## Hi there 👋

I work at Huawei Technologies <img src='./images/huawei.jpg' style='width: 6em;'> as a research scientist now in Beijing. 

I am now working on language identification, machine translation and LLM Agent research. If you are seeking any form of **employment opportunity**, please feel free to email me at [dingjianbang1@huawei.com](mailto:dingjianbang1@huawei.com). We are also **hiring interns**!

I graduated from [School of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), Peking University (北京大学智能学院) with a master's degree, supervised by [Prof. Zhihong Deng (邓志鸿)](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/dzh.htm) and from Qian Xuesen Class, Xidian University (西安电子科技大学钱学森班) with a bachelor's degree. I also collaborate with [Prof. Xu Sun (孙栩)](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1078/1673.htm) closely.

I won the [CCL 2023 Best Poster Award](http://cips-cl.org/?p=87826) and the [Huawei Top-10 Patents Nomination Award](https://www.huawei.com/cn/news/2022/6/ipr-2022) (华为终端BG十大发明提名). [My work](https://www.beidouunion.com/kjzy/news_349.html) was selected by the Xi'an Municipal Government for exhibition at the 2017 Silk Road International Expo (2017丝绸之路国际博览会). I have published several papers at the premier international AI conferences such as IJCNN, NLPCC and CCL.
